#Credit-Card-Revenue-Customer-Segmentation-Dashboard

I worked on a Credit Card Analysis project to explore customer behavior, revenue generation, and transaction trends. I used SQL for querying and data extraction, and Power BI for building interactive dashboards. The raw data was cleaned using Excel, and I created visuals that deliver clear insights to business stakeholders.

##Project Objective:
The main goal was to uncover spending behavior, revenue trends, and customer segmentation insights to help a bank understand which customer groups and card types drive the most value—and where improvements can be made in marketing, service, or credit risk.

What I Analyzed:

Revenue Performance
1. Tracked total revenue (~₹56M), interest earned (₹8M), and transaction volume by quarter, card type, and payment mode (swipe, chip, online).
2. Blue cards dominated usage with ~₹47M in revenue.

Customer Segmentation
1. Created breakdowns by job type, education level, age group, dependents, and marital status.
2. Found that businessmen, postgraduates, and customers aged 60+ were among the highest revenue generators.

Spending Trends by Category
1. High spending in bills, entertainment, fuel, groceries, etc.
2. Time-based analysis showed stable revenue across quarters, with slight peaks in Q2 and Q4.

Behavioral Insights
1. Males generated slightly more revenue than females, and higher-income groups contributed most to credit card revenue.
2. States like California (CA), Texas (TX), and New Jersey (NJ) stood out in revenue contribution.

Tools & Skills Used:
SQL: Wrote queries to filter and join customer and transaction tables.
Excel: Used for initial data cleaning, formatting, and validation.
Power BI: Built dashboards using slicers, bar/line charts, DAX measures, and card visuals.

Business Impact:
1. This project helps a bank or financial institution:
2. Identify high-value customer segments to target with premium offerings.
3. Improve card marketing strategies based on actual usage and demographics.
4. Monitor quarterly performance, allowing data-driven decisions.
